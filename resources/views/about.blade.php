                    A Minute Jesus Devotional is a Family of Believers with a Passion to Know God and walk in His Ways
                    and in the manifestation of His Power!

                    Our Vision is That All The Nations of The World Will Come to The Knowledge of God and The Knowledge
                    of His Son Jesus Christ Whom He Sent, and in so doing, Have Eternal Life in Experience.

                    This Vision is anchored as a Revelation from John 17:3
                    This is Eternal Life, That We May Know Him, The One True God, And Jesus Christ Whom He Sent!

                    If you have found yourself in this family, then it is God's Desire that You experience Eternal life
                    through the Knowledge of Him and His Son. Eternal life is not life after death, that is everlasting
                    life. Eternal life is the Life of God. It is a High Quality Life that allows us to Live The Life
                    Jesus Lived when He walked upon the earth, as Ordained By The Father. It is called Zoe Life.

                    That soon enough, it will be said of all of us here like it was said of Jesus, This is My Beloved
                    Son, In Whom I am Well Pleased (Matthew 3:17) and This Is My Beloved Son, Hear Ye Him (Luke 9:35)

                    What a Better Knowledge than to Know God and His Son?
