                <h1 class="pa-h1-v2 pa-dark fadeInDelay00Duration10"><strong></strong> I Testify
                </h1>
                <p class="pa-p-v1 pa-dark fadeInDelay03Duration10">We have been learning about Our Mandate of Knowing
                    God, and Making Him Known, Revealing Him to The Nations and being part of Manifesting God's Purposes
                    on earth. We have learnt that do that, there are things that God has given us as spiritual
                    disciplines, our daily Consecrations and food that allow us to stay on the narrow path in focus to
                    fully Manifest that which God has spoken over our lives. So far we have seen four of them, Verse of
                    The Day, Proverb Of The, Psalm of The Day and Daily Promises From God. Today we look at the next
                    one, I Testify Session.

                    A Testimony is an Intentional Act of Giving Honor and Glory to God by Telling others what God has
                    done to you. It helps to prove that God is moving In your life and builds the faith of others
                    listening to you by helping them know that if God did it for you, He can do it for them too. To
                    testify is one of the greatest ways of Giving Thanks to God.

                    What are The Benefits of Testimonies?
                    What are The Four Main Reasons as to why we should always Testify?

                    1. Testimonies Bring Glory and Honor to The Name of The Lord
                    â€­Psalm 22:22
                    I will declare Thy Name unto my brethren: In the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee.
                    Everytime you Testify, You Glorify God and in so doing, you create a platform and an atmosphere for
                    the congregation and everyone hearing you to Honor The Lord.
                    When you are lifted up, when God does something for you and you Testify about it, You are Giving
                    Glory and Honor To Jesus!
                    What a Better responsibility than to do that?

                    2. Testimonies Prove That God can be Trusted and That His Word is True
                    Psalm 22:24
                    For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, Neither Has He Hid His Face
                    from him, But when he cried unto Him, He Heard
                    When you Testify, you prove that God's Word can be trusted. He said He will Heal you and Then He
                    Heals you? When You Testify, You show that You can trust God. He said He will Bless You financially
                    and at your work and then He does it? When You Testify you Prove that He is a Covenant Keeping God.
                    Romans 10:11
                    Whoever Believes on Him shall not be put to Shame.
                    Testimonies help us understand that we can trust God to do all that He said
                    Genesis 21:1
                    And the Lord Visited Sarah (Put your name) as He had Said, and The Lord did To Sarah as He had
                    spoken

                    3. Testimonies Act as a Seal to The Miracles that have Been Received
                    When You Testify, you put a seal to what God has done. You commit God's integrity in your life. You
                    put pressure on God to preserve that testimony. You provoke wholeness to your testimony. You provoke
                    God to perfect what He has started.
                    Luke 17:11-19 talks about the story of the 10 Lepers. Jesus healed them but only one came to Testify
                    and give thanks. It Is recorded that He was made whole. There was a completion of that which God had
                    started to do. Keep Testifying and you will see a perfection of what God has started to do in your
                    life.

                    4. A Testimony is The Spirit of Prophecy!
                    This is one of the Most Powerful Revelations you can ever have about Testimonies. When you Testify,
                    you are actually Prophecying. When someone is giving a Testimony, they are Prophecying that it will
                    happen again.
                    Revelation 19:10 Says that The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy. What this means is that
                    everytime you Testify of Jesus, you create an atmosphere of duplication of that Testimony in your
                    life and the life of others. When David stood before Goliath, He started Testifying of what God did
                    for him before, Helping him to overcome bears and lions in the wilderness (1 Samuel 17). As He was
                    doing it, He activated the prophetic possibility of Testimonies that the same God who helped Him
                    overcome then is the same God who will help him overcome Goliath now. When you stand before a
                    Mountain, Start Testifying of what God has done and you will be surprised at how the Mountain will
                    go down. As you Testify, other people's faith will also be lifted to believe that God can do it for
                    them too, for The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy!

                    These are the 4 main reasons as to why we Testify. Now that you know them, never stop doing them and
                    you will see How God will Glorify Himself through victories and great results in your life.

                    God Bless you.</p>
